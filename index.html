        You were told that the monster lives out there — in systems, nations, algorithms, strangers. It is more convenient that way. If the monster is always somewhere else, you never have to look too closely at your own hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        This place exists to remove that convenience.
        Here, the assumption is simple and uncomfortable:
        <strong>the most dangerous thing in your world might be the part of you that you refuse to see.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I write under no face and no name. Not because there is something to hide, but because there is nothing to sell. These letters are not self-help, not doctrine, not rebellion for its own sake. They are mirrors held at an angle you are rarely allowed to use.
      </p>

      <div class="question">
        The only real question of this project is:<br>
        <strong>When you say “monster”, what exactly are you pointing at inside yourself?</strong>
      </div>

      <p>
        Over time, you will find essays here — long, slow, and precise — and responses to anonymous letters from people who are willing to stare at their own shadow a little longer than is comfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Read. Disagree. Write back. But whatever you do, do not pretend that you walked away unchanged.
