  <!-- GITHUB COPILOT INSTRUCTION:
Refactor this page into a 2-column layout with a left sidebar and the existing content as the main area.

Requirements:
- Assume shared styles are in /style.css and already include .layout and .sidebar classes.
- Wrap the whole page body in:
  <div class="layout">
    <aside class="sidebar">...</aside>
    <main>...</main>
  </div>
- Inside <aside class="sidebar">, create:
  - A small label div with class="sidebar-title" and text "monsterwithinyou".
  - A <nav class="sidebar-nav"> with links:
      <a href="/" class="active">homepage</a>
      <a href="/day1/">day 1</a>
      <a href="/day2/">day 2</a>
    (I will manually add day3, day4, etc. later.)
- Move the existing header/section/footer content into the <main> element WITHOUT changing any text content or structure.
- Do not change the <head> section. Keep <link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css"> as it is.
- Only modify the structure inside <body>. -->

  <main>
    <header>
      <div class="eyebrow">A quiet experiment in radical honesty</div>
      <h1>
        <span class="accent">Monster,</span> within, you
      </h1>
      <div class="subtitle">
        A faceless philosophical project. No brand. No guru. Only the part of you that you spend your life avoiding.
      </div>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p>
        You were told that the monster lives out there — in systems, nations, algorithms, strangers. It is more convenient that way. If the monster is always somewhere else, you never have to look too closely at your own hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        This place exists to remove that convenience.
        Here, the assumption is simple and uncomfortable:
        <strong>the most dangerous thing in your world might be the part of you that you refuse to see.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I write under no face and no name. Not because there is something to hide, but because there is nothing to sell. These letters are not self-help, not doctrine, not rebellion for its own sake. They are mirrors held at an angle you are rarely allowed to use.
      </p>

      <div class="question">
        The only real question of this project is:<br>
        <strong>When you say “monster”, what exactly are you pointing at inside yourself?</strong>
      </div>

      <p>
        Over time, you will find essays here — long, slow, and precise — and responses to anonymous letters from people who are willing to stare at their own shadow a little longer than is comfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Read. Disagree. Write back. But whatever you do, do not pretend that you walked away unchanged.
